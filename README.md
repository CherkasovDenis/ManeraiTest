Move with WASD, rotate the camera with the mouse, interact with objects with LMB. 
3 objects - a sphere, a capsule and a cylinder. "Backpack" - a green cube. 
After throwing an object into the "backpack", it is smoothly attracted to its position on the backpack. 
When you point at the backpack and press LMB - a UI appears above the backpack, which displays the names of the current objects in the backpack. If, without releasing LMB, you point the sight at the name of the object and release LMB - the object will be taken out of the backpack.
